	From a very young age, his talent for music was obvious. He was known to memorise all four parts of songs being taught at choir rehearsals. At age seven he started composing for his colleagues at Sunday School. He started playing the church organ when he was eleven.

	James became the principal organist for the Winneba Youth Choir from 2000 to July 2007. He worked with Paa John, the choir's director, to lift the image of WYC. It has since become one of Ghana's leading choirs.
