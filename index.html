		Harmonious Chorale makes history on the continent by being the first major ensemble to perform Handel's obscure <i>Joseph and his Brethren</i> in July of this year. Before that, Celestial Evangel Choir, the biggest choral ensemble in Kumasi, performs Handel's <i>Messiah</i> at St. George's in Adum. The WitsHarmonic Choir presents the second edition of its Republic Concert, featuring themes of national and social importance.
