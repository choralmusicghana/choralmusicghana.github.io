		<hr>
		<i>“Mɛ Dɔ Wo”</i> was composed by Elijah Gyasi Nimako. This piece is in English and Twi. This duet is written in the contemporary style but it maintains its Ghanaian authenticity in word-choice, rhythm and idiom. It is in B Major, in natural time. 
		<br>
		After each voice sings the theme, the male and female melodies run counterpoint against each other: first in harmony then in a perfect octave. At the end of the piece, there is a brief period of imitative counterpoint that seems to demonstrate the give and take of Love.
		<br>
		The song is a declaration of mutual love by the two singers.

		<i>“Stay with Me”</i> was composed by Elikem Seake-Kwaku. It is in A♭ Major and in natural time. It has syncopations in the accompaniment, which become very prominent toward the end of the piece. The song starts with arpeggios played by the piano. This gets the listener thinking of it as a contemporary piece. Also, the duet is set in the Romantic style. Thus, we realise a combination of two different styles in the music. Elikem includes spoken passages in his composition. 
		<br>
		This love song focuses on two lovers feeling lonely and craving each other. They share the extent of their love and cry to stay with each other.
