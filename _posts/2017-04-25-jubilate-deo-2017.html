JUBILATE DEO is an annual choral concert organised by the Ghana Methodist Students Union in KNUST. The 2017 edition took place at the university's Great Hall on Saturday, 1st April 2017. Among the invited choirs to perform that night were the NUPS-G Choir, from the National Union of Presbyterian Students, and the Pop Choir.

The programme begun with an opening prayer and a worship session led by the Pop Choir, after a prelude and curtain raiser by Kwesi Twum and Offeibea. NUPS-G Choir was first to mount the stage with a good starter for the concert. 

After the opening performances, the host choir mounted the stage with their package for the night. They ministered a number of hymns from the Methodist Hymn Book. Their last performance was William Steffe <i>Battle Hymn of the Republic.</i> This popular hymn was so well performed by Pax Choir KNUST at their last <i>Night of Hymns</i> that I was eager to see how this one will go. I was not disappointed.

After a ministration from the MSA Choir, the hosts resumed with the second part of their performance. Among the pieces they ministered included Isaac Watts' <i>Almighty Ruler of the Skies</i>, <i>Joshua I Come Commissioned</i> and Rossini's <i>La Danza</i>. They included a few local favourites such as Kenn Kafui's <i>Mida Akpe</i> and <i>Adepa Nyinaa</i>

There was a brief exhortation by Rev. Ebenezer Kusi Appiah.

After this, the host choir mounted the stage one last time to sing a selection of "danceables". My favourite that night was <i>Abaayewa</i>, a song accompanied by a "play". That piece, performed to emphasise its folkloric nature, turned out to be very relatable. <i>Abaayewa</i> admonishes young girls not to be anxious for men.

Handel's <i>Hallelujah Chorus</i>, the so-called Christian international anthem, ended the night.
