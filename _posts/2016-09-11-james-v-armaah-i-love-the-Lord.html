<p class="intro">
    To God be the glory, great things He hath done,<br>

    So loved He the world that He gave us His Son,<br>

    Who yielded His life our redemption to win,<br>

    And opened the lifegate that all may go in.<br>

    Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,<br>

    Let the earth hear His voice;<br>

    Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,<br>

    Let the people rejoice;<br>

    Oh, come to the Father, through Jesus the Son,<br>

    And give Him the glory; great things He hath done

    It was the book launch of I LOVE THE LORD by James Varrick Armaah, one of Ghana’s finest choral music composers. It
    was a day that fixed the joy of all who were present at the Trinity United Church, East Legon, exactly a month after
    witnessing Kenn Kafui’s book launch at Christ The King
</p>
<p>
    James Varrick Armaah is the Executive Director of the Harmonious Chorale Ghana, one of Ghana’s finest choral
    ensembles. He holds a Master of Philosophy in Music at the University of Ghana and MBA at the Central University
    College. He has more than 300 compositions to his name with many more in the pipeline. His ingenuity has established
    him as one of the highest profile contemporary Ghanaian choral music composers, the likes of which include Emeritus
    J.N.K Nketiah, Kenn Kafui, Prof. Sekyi Baidoo, George Essilfie Mensah, Rev Donkor, Rev. Dr. Newlove Annan.
</p>
<p>
    His preceding album, Odo Ben Nie which was launched two years ago to commemorate his 30th birthday celebration,
    includes some of his finest compositions such as Nkwagye Kura and Menim nea Menya. The new book comes along with
    thirty-three beautiful compositions titled “I LOVE THE LORD”.

    The launch was well attended by many people from all facets of the choral music industry with other distinguished
    dignitaries from the clergy and the chieftaincy. The programme was chaired by Rev. Dr. Joyce Aryee, the Director of
    the Salt and Light Ministries (SALM), and supported by the king of the Osu Alata clan who also doubles as a
    chorister of the Christ Anglican Church, Legon. The surviving patriarch of art music in Ghana, Emeritus Joseph Nana
    Kwabena Nketiah and his wife were also in attendance with composers both renowned and upcoming.
</p>

<p>
    In attendance were the performing choirs: Harmonious Chorale Ghana, Vocal Essence Chorale and The Symphonials from
    Valley View University. Gramophone Ghana which holds its next edition of Fellowship of Songs at the same venue were
    present to extend their support, as well as Glorious Philharmonic Choir. The organizers of the Ghana Youth Choir
    festival were in attendance to grace the occasion together with a massive crowd of choral music lovers filling the
    auditorium to brim.

</p>
<p>
    The programme kicked off with the rendition of Armaah’s O Happy Day That Fixed my Choice, which was beautifully sung
    by the mass choir comprising of Harmonious Chorale Ghana, Vocal Essence Chorale and Symphonials, and followed with
    an opening prayer. Minister Nii Okai, one of Ghana’s established gospel musicians took over with his solemn and
    soothing ministration of Armaah’s Anka Me Ne Hwan, which ushered us into the realms of the content of the new book.

    Ndwom, all composed by James Varrick Armaah, and another ministration of I have learnt to trust in Jesus by Nii Okai

<p>
    The Symphonials of Valley View had their turn to Heavenly Father, Nea Nyame aye dooso, Wo haw ne sen and Ewuradze

    music in Ghana, Rev. Dr. Joyce Aryee with the highest bids at Ghc 3000, Ghc 2000 and Ghc 500 respectively. The

    ntumi nye with Mrs. Karen Dadzie of Harmonious Chorale Ghana rendering a solo and Anka me wo hen with Uncle Ben

    The book “I LOVE THE LORD” was launched and auctioned by <em>Rev. Dr. Joyce Aryee </em>at various prices ranging
    between Gh
    3000 and Gh 100. Invited guests like Nii Kwabena Bonne V and others offered varying support towards the exercise
    besides getting copies of the book. Many copies of the book were bought by the audience and attending groups under
    the catchphrase – “One chorister, One book”, a similar exercise done at Kenn Kafui’s book launch some weeks ago. One
    Chorister, One Book, is a new initiative to help arrest and wipe out the copyright syndrome in the choral music
    industry, which disincentives composers.. Below is a breakdown of purchases by some choral groups:<br>
</p>
<br>

<p>
    Harmonious Chorale Ghana - 75 copies <br><br>

    Symphonials - 80 copies<br><br>

    Christ Anglican Church, Legon - 30 copies<br><br>

    Trinity United Church - 20 copies<br><br>

</p>
<br>

<p><br>
    Do you love the Lord? If you do, then get a copy of "I Love the Lord"-by James Varrick Armaah for GHs 40.00
