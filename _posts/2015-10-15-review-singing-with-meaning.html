<p class="intro">Jesse from Choral Music Ghana attended his first Singing with Meaning organised by the IMCS Pax Romana
    Choir, University of Ghana, Legon. He tells us what the experience was like, and what he wishes could be done the
    next time.</p><!-- more -->
<p>At ten minutes to
    six, I was lugging a heavy bag towards the St. Thomas Aquinas
    Catholic Church behind the Nursing School, Legon. The first hints of
    what was to come were the faint strains of <i>What a friend we have in
        Jesus</i>&nbsp;coming from the chapel that met me as I crossed the car park.</p><p>This was my first
    <i>Singing with Meaning</i>, an annual event organised by <a href="https://twitter.com/PaxChoirUG">Pax Choir UG</a>.
    I
    entered the chapel with some preconceptions, coming from Pax Choir
    KNUST with its <i>Night of Hymns</i> (which was held about two weeks ago) in
    Kumasi.
</p><p>I expected good
    hymns plus something extra from our sister choir in Accra. I expected
    choristers in front of the altar, behind their mic stands rehearsing
    with the sound engineers as parishioners filled the pews and watched
    on. I didn&rsquo;t expect to see Blessed Yawson of Living Choir
    coordinating things with Senanu.</p><p>Blessed is a young
    composer and founder of the Living Choir. He&rsquo;s active with the Corpus
    Christi Philharmonic Choir, whom I joined for a small concert at that
    parish some years ago. We&rsquo;ll speak to Blessed and his choir later
    this year when they have their annual Christmas concert. For now,
    it&rsquo;s about Pax Choir.</p>

<p>The choristers
    were
    in the traditional black and white. A few minutes after I settled,
    the clock struck six and they descended, making way for the evening&rsquo;s
    rosary prayers. <i>Singing with Meaning</i> began sometime after six thirty.</p><p>I was more than
    pleased with the participation. The hall quickly filled up soon after
    the night began. Rev. Fr Larweh, the chaplain, acted as the MC who
    introduced the choir, thankfully called for audience participation by
    keeping quiet &ldquo;so we can listen to these youthful voices&rdquo; and
    summarised the purpose of the night&rsquo;s gathering.</p><p>Singing with Meaning
    is a celebration of church music that goes a step beyond just
    singing: its aim is to teach the audience something about the music
    they are listening to, where the compositions came from, what
    inspired them and what meaning can be drawn from the words. If you&rsquo;ve
    listened to Joyce Aryee&rsquo;s <i>Hymns and their Meaning</i> on Sunny FM (every
    Sunday from 4pm) you should be at home with this idea.</p><p>Ten hymns were sang
    that night from Europe, the United States and Ghana.</p><p>Pax Choir processed
    with the patriotic hymn <i>Amansuon Twerapon</i>. The order of the
    procession struck me: basses and tenors led. For those of us sitting
    in front, we had the peculiar experience of hearing the bass and
    tenor harmony before the melody of the music. The mood was almost
    church like: I felt as though I were at a religious ceremony and not
    a concert to celebrate music for music&rsquo;s sake.</p><p>The first hymn of
    the night was <i><a
            href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FTe_Deum&amp;t=ZjhmZWJjODE2MTFmODBjMDFmZWQzOTM0MTAwMjMyMThiOTY4ZTFlNyxCamJsU1lTMA%3D%3D">Te
        Deum Laudamus</a></i>. It is an early church hymn that sees
    regular use in significant ceremonies in the Catholic Church. Its
    origins are disputed, but the words of this hymn have been set to
    music by several composers over several hundred years. The music on
    Friday night was the traditional hymn.</p>

<p>Despite the
    steady
    pace of the music, the conducting was charged and enthusiastic,
    almost charismatic. Patrick, the choir master, showed much character
    throughout the night. He did much more than keep time with flailing
    arms: Patrick communicated emotion to his choir and they, in turn,
    sang back to us as expected. It&rsquo;s a pity the audience could only see
    him from behind. His emphatic direction reminded me of my favourite
    conductor, Gustavo Dudamel.</p><p>&nbsp;Pity there was no official video coverage
    of this splendid act.</p><p>The verse of the
    second hymn, <a
            href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FTell_me_the_old%2C_old_story&amp;t=NDllOGY0ZmZkODljN2NiYmU3MGUwYjBhYjVkNjBhYjNmODVmYWFhMixCamJsU1lTMA%3D%3D"><i>Tell
        Me the Old Old Story</i> </a>sung by a quartet somehow
    came out muffled. Feedback from the giant speakers (I was unfortunate to sit right in front of them) made listening
    painful. The
    music finally took off when the choir sang the last verse in unison.
    Patrick, true to his character, signaled the end of the music with a
    heart. His little trick of genius had me smiling.</p>

<p>Mary Magdalene,
    an
    alumnus of the choir sang a solo during the third hymn, <i>Oduyefo Kese</i>.
    The Fante harmony of this hymn was written by<i>&nbsp;Prof. Sekyi Baidoo</i>. I first
    heard Mary during Pax Choir&rsquo;s Esther Oratorio performed in 2013. She
    sang as Esther and there established herself in my mind as one of the
    best soloists I&rsquo;ve heard in person. Mary Magdalene is also a member
    of Blessed&rsquo;s Living Choir.</p><p>Thankfully, the
    audience were quiet for this very beautiful hymn and I had the chance
    to sit back and take it all in. Since the procession, I hadn&rsquo;t paid
    much attention to the male voices. The bass and tenor voices sang a
    duet at the fourth verse. The severity of the voices as they made
    their way through the verse sent my mind back to some of my favourite
    hymns from the Russian Orthodox Church.</p>

<p>It was from this
    moment that the performance became truly stellar. A good choir leaves
    the audience lost in the music they are singing. At <i>Guide, Please,
        Our Life&rsquo;s Dark Ocean (CH 287),</i> I felt one more time that joy that
    comes with music sung perfectly &ndash; so perfectly it makes one uneasy.
    Pleasantly uneasy.</p><p>The basses sang with
    one voice, better than I&rsquo;ve ever heard them. Again, they did it with
    that severity I love in a good hymn. I found myself at the edge of my
    seat throughout this hymn.</p><p><i>GNAAS Choir UG</i> were
    in attendance as the guest choir. This is the third time I&rsquo;ve heard
    them as guests at another choir&rsquo;s event. I really wish I get to see
    them on home turf soon.&nbsp;</p><p>Their music was most
    pleasant when they sang unaccompanied. I may have developed a
    mistrust for accompaniment after several bad experiences where the
    instruments have taken the foreground, leaving the voices lost behind
    a facade of brash sounds. That said, the choristers did remarkably
    well to produce a massive sound despite their small number.</p><p>They were followed
    by the Pax Choir alumni choir. Among the hymns they sang, <i>Sweet
        Sacrament Divine</i> was by far the most glorious. I&rsquo;ve had some personal
    history with this hymn. For much of my listening life, I actually
    disliked it. I found the music too churchy, lacking drama and tension (in words and music) and every other thing I
    expected in my favourite music.</p><p>Ten years ago, my
    perception changed during the Holy Week services at church back at
    home. On Friday, the almuni choir added another layer of appreciation
    to this hymn. I may have permanently fallen in love with the tenor
    harmony! So far, I haven&rsquo;t been disappointed by any Pax Choir Alumni
    ensemble. I&rsquo;ve mused more than once that the chorister&rsquo;s voices
    &ldquo;mature&rdquo; after graduation. Every almuni choir I&rsquo;ve heard sings
    with confidence that matches (and often exceeds) other professional
    choirs I&rsquo;ve heard. They should become more regular features in our
    choral music scene.</p><p>The rest of the
    night continued as expected: the music was remarkable, the conducting
    exuberant (my favourite perk of being a photographer: I got some
    exciting shots!) and the audience mostly decent.</p>

<p>The greatest
    disappointment was, there was no official recording of the night&rsquo;s
    music. If you were not present on Friday, I can&rsquo;t describe well
    enough what you missed. An amateur recording may do some justice for
    now.&nbsp;</p><p>We&rsquo;re looking forward to a more complete coverage of next year&rsquo;s
    Singing with Meaning.</p>
