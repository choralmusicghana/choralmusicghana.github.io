<p class="intro">If you have attended one too many funerals in Ghana, then you have probably heard &#8220;<em>Where is
    our God in whom we
    trust</em>&#8221; sang very solemnly usually accompanied by a regimental band. Did you know though, that is was
    composed
    by one of our own? I discovered this one Friday when I googled the song and expected to see a YouTube video with the
    name of a foreign composer but was met with the name of my own countryman.</p>

<p>James Hackman Tachie-Menson who passed on only last year at a ripe age of 85 was a Ghanaian captain who composed
    several songs at sea. He is known to be the first Black African captain of a ship. I felt very glad to discover a
    Ghanaian who wrote songs while sailing because that picture has never been a part of my imagination. Aside &#8220;Where
    is our God in whom we trust&#8221;, he has written other songs you have definitely sung in church before including
    the popular tune used in Ghana for &#8220;Hark Hark my soul, angelic songs are swelling&#8221;.</p>
<p>Learn more about him from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Hackman_Tachie-Menson">Wikipedia</a> and his <a
        href="http://www.captaintachie-menson.com/">website</a>.</p>
<p>Listen to some of this songs <a href="http://www.tabbica.com/music.php">here</a>.</p>
<p>The sol-fas for &#8220;Where is our God&#8221; can also be found <a

<p>The YouTube video is still lacking though. If you are part of a choir that can be backed by a great regimental band,
    why don&#8217;t you sing it and upload it on YouTube so that I can listen heartily?</p>
<p>I&#8217;d be waiting for you to make me smile.</p>
