<p><b>CMG</b> : Good
    evening, Fiifi<br></p><p><b>Fiifi</b> : Good evening, How are you doing?</p><p><b>CMG</b>: Doing well. We want to
    put you on CMG spotlight. We would like to learn more about your musical life.<br></p><p><b>Fiifi</b>: Really? Wow!
    I&rsquo;m shy. </p><p><b>CMG</b>: Haha. </p><p><b>Fiif</b>i : Well. Where can we start from?</p><p><b>Fiifi</b>: My
    music career started at the age of 11 when I started playing the keyboard but lost interest and stopped till after 5
    years when I was introduced into a junior choir which had just started. I was a tenor singer and was made a part
    leader. </p><p><b>CMG</b>: Wow. Your choirmaster must have seen a lot in you.</p><p><b>Fiifi</b>: Yes. Since the
    choir commenced, I realized I had a passion for singing. I actually felt awkward if I was not singing. </p><p>
    <b>CMG</b>: (smiles) Interesting. That is real passion at work. </p><p><b>Fiifi</b>: A more interesting point in my
    story came when I met Michael Nana Adu Ntow, who is now a friend. He has been such an inspiration. He came once to
    our rehearsal and met me sitting behind the keyboard. He told me that I can learn how to play and immediately taught
    me the basics. From that day, we had lessons together and that was how I began playing the keyboard again. </p>

<p><b>CMG</b>: That&rsquo;s
    wonderful. A great inspiration. </p><p><b>Fiifi</b>: Thank you. One of my mentors too is one of our music directors.
    He was with us for 7 years before leaving. He is the person of Mr. James Varrick Armaah, executive director of
    Harmonious Chorale Ghana. </p><p><b>CMG</b>: You have a simple but inspiring story. At least, I have learnt that no
    age is too late to start playing the piano. So what do you do currently, Fiifi. </p><p><b>Fiifi</b>: I&rsquo;m
    currently a choir master/organist for Mount Moriah Church Choir, Tema Diocesan Choir and the Tema Circuit Choir all
    of the Methodist Church Ghana. I have also been an adjudicator during two major diocesan conferences, one held in Ho
    Tsito and the other in Ashaiman at the Tema International School.</p>

<p>CMG: What is your
    future ambition for your musical life?</p><p><b>Fiifi</b>: I want to rise to the top to become one of the most
    promising musicians in Ghana. I will say I am still learning and the sky will definitely be our starting point. </p>
<p><b>CMG</b>: Tell us something interesting about yourself. Something not music related. </p><p><b>Fiifi</b>: (laughs)
    Okay, I am the first of 3 guys. My favourite food is jollof rice and chicken and I like spending time with the
    keyboard. </p><p><b>CMG</b> : (Smiles) I thought you were going to say you like spending time with your girlfriend.
    All the same, thank you Fiifi. It has been a pleasure talking to you. </p>
