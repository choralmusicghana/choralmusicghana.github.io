<p class="intro">Jermaine Kudiabor spoke to Theophilus Adu Bredu over the weekend for his thoughts on the journey so far with
    Bel Canto Chorus and Alfred Patrick Addaquay.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On 30th August history was made as the first
    oratorio composed by a Ghanaian was performed.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Laudateur Christus</i> is the work of Patrick Alfred
    Addaquay, arguably Ghana&rsquo;s foremost concert pianist and classical musician and he chose his own Bel Canto
    Chorus to render it. And boy did they render it.&nbsp;</p><!-- more --><p>This wasn&rsquo;t the first time we at CMG
    have heard of Bel Canto Chorus and over the weekend I interacted with their assistant organist Theophilus Adu Bredu
    to talk about the choir that is making such huge waves in Ghana&rsquo;s choral music scene.<br></p>

<p>According to
    Theophilus, Bel Canto started as Navidad Chorus, a collection of individuals &ndash; mostly IMCS Pax Romana Choir
    alumni from University of Cape Coast who were based in Kumasi. The purpose of the choir was to minister solely at
    Christian feast days like Christmas. </p><p>On 1st September 2014 Navidad Chorus was renamed Bel Canto Chorus with
    Patrick Nana Sarfo as main director and Patrick Alfred Addaquay as its musical director. Right now Bel Canto has a
    modest number of forty with about thirty active members.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The main purpose of the choir is to praise God with music and interpret it beyond human
    imagination.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Bel Canto achieves this by having all night Friday rehearsals at Kaase
    Catholic Church, Kumasi. &ldquo;Within this period choristers are taught music&hellip; we also hold workshops on
    voice, dynamics and the likes.&rdquo; Knowing Theo as well as I do it&rsquo;s not difficult to imagine the pride
    with which he types these words. &ldquo;After learning and rendering the songs we actually compare them to an
    international choir and critique ourselves.&rdquo;</p><p>When I asked how he joined Bel Canto he answered, &ldquo;I
    am a student of P A Addaquay&hellip; my major challenge was which choir in Ghana can help me mature my love for
    (musical) interpretation? I told Addaquay about it and after long deliberation (he) suggested the new baby Bel Canto
    Chorus to me. They had only just changed the name then.&rdquo;</p><p>When the conversation shifted as it obviously
    would to Addaquay, there were more glowing words of praise. &ldquo;Working with him is one of the best things you
    could have as a Ghanaian musician. He has wide knowledge and imaginative skill. Consciously or unconsciously you
    begin to see music in a different way.&rdquo;</p><p>That seems evident because within one year of its reformation
    Bel Canto has pleased with its Life of Christ concert held at several venues in Accra, Cape Coast and Kumasi. The
    latest favourite being of course, <i>Laudateur Christus</i>. The <i>Messiah</i> inspired oratorio was performed at
    the Covenant Family Community Church to great applause and Theo promises repeat performances in several other
    regions before the year ends. Have no doubt that CMG will be the first to let you know those dates.</p><p><b>If you
    are in Kumasi and want to be a part of this young choir&rsquo;s bright future, contact their director Patrick Nana
    Sarfo on (+233) 0242318619.</b><br></p>
