<p>In the course of 2015, various choirs released albums and I&rsquo;d like to share with you what they have for us.<br>
</p><!-- more --><p>Let&rsquo;s begin with the youngest one.<a
        href="http://blog.choralmusicghana.com/post/135200893765/review-the-living-choirs-maiden-album-launch"> <i>Taste
    and See</i>, produced by the Living Choir</a> under the directorship of Mr. Blessed Yawson. The songs on the album
    are compositions and arrangements by the above mentioned director who is also the founder of the thirteen (13) man
    choir. And they really do impress!</p><p>The arrangement of songs in the album alternate between contrasting styles:
    local <i>highlifes</i> and more solemn anthems.</p><p>The instrumental introduction to the first song takes us to
    the shores of <i>Ga Mashie</i>, with their <i>gome</i> box drum. Its strong beat, together with other instruments
    set the rhythm for you to either tap your feet or shake your body alongside; then the voices are added and we have
    our titular song <i>Taste and See.</i></p><p>The next track, <i>Adoration</i>, is a medley of some contemporary&nbsp;songs,
    including <i>As The Deer Panteth</i>. In this composition, the chromatic notes add colour to the piece and draws one
    into the song. The tenor and soprano soloists did a good job; their command over the voice was refreshing.</p>
<p>
    However, I
    thought in&nbsp;<i>My Help</i>, which is in classic choral form, the singers did not gel well with their entries at
    some parts of the song. And being polyphonic in texture, this caused the singing to sound slightly off.</p><p>Apart
    from instances where the singers&rsquo; phrasing was not properly coordinated, the harmony was orchestrated
    beautifully and the chord progressions were good albeit with too many embellishments by the keyboardist.</p><p>
    During the year, the Gramophone Chorus gave us four (4) albums, each from the Fellowship of Songs event they held. I
    have listened to all but one, their very last one.</p><p>Theirs follows a pattern of selected classicals, hymns,
    Ghanaian anthems and then highlifes. </p>

<p>The first, <i>Pre Easter Meditations</i>, features a majestic rendition
    of J.S. Bach&rsquo;s <i>Jesu Joy of Man&rsquo;s Desiring</i>. Then we have some hymns and then comes on <i>Thine Be
        The Glory,</i> with the opening intro which gets you literally high. The anthem begins with much energy, then
    falls in <i>ritardando</i> during the second stanza, culminating in a deceptive cadence at the end of the third. The
    pace of singing returns <i>a tempo</i> and the anthem marches on towards a thrilling end: a truly beautiful
    expression both by the organists and singers.</p><p>The danceable tunes are simple yet harmoniously orchestrated and
    that&rsquo;s one big plus for me. There&rsquo;re not over-the-top embellishments and so it was easy on the ear.</p>
<p>On<i> Prayer, Worship and Thanksgiving</i>, the second album from their staples, the calming rearrangement of <i>Blessed
    Assurance</i> is one song to look out for. In this album however, Gramophone Chorus adds spice by taking a few songs
    of the contemporary genre and creating an interesting medley; some of them include <i>Oguanma Se Ayeyi</i> and <i>Wo
        Kronkron Yi Ye Me F3</i>. Do note that the songs have been rearranged for SATB.</p><p>The strong beat of the
    bass drum keeping time, the keyboard and flute playing the opening intro and coupled with the subtle flute all
    culminate into the intro of Battle Hymn Republic on the third album, <i>Always On Our Side</i>.</p><p>In all three
    albums out of the four that I have listened to, I must point out that articulation was quite good. Each voice
    sounded as one (no competition in there for the &ldquo;best soloist&rdquo; to be heard). The bass was airy and could
    be heard and felt carrying each of the songs. Alto was also on point &ndash; not sounding nasal but light and fun
    and thereby adding colour to the harmony. </p>

<p>And finally, Pax
    Choir KNUST outdoored <i>His Love, Our Thanks</i>, a collection of songs written and &nbsp;composed by Rev. Newlove
    Annan, a renowned Ghanaian composer. In addition is <i>The Grace</i>, a composition by one of their alumni &ndash;
    Ernest J. B. Danquah.</p><p>The sixteen (16) song album starts off with <i>Me Nyame Afr3 Me</i>, written in strophic
    form as is common of hymns, followed by <i>Mensuro Hwee,&nbsp;</i>a <i>rondo.</i></p><p>The soothing intro of <i>Onim</i>
    is one that everyone should listen to. The keyboard sets off the tone and gives way to a saxophone, that creates a
    jazzy feel to the music. This orchestration is refreshing. The four soloists taking different sections of the song
    totes to the mood as well.</p><p><i>The Grace</i> rounds off the hymns in the album. The Alto carries the melody,
    just like in Handel&rsquo;s <i>And The Glory</i>. I must commend Mr. Danquah here for composing a song in polyphonic
    in texture that is not hard on the ear. </p><p>A distinct feature with this choir&rsquo;s <i>highlifes</i> is that
    solos were incorporated into each of them. These solos contain chromatic tones that spritz more verve on the songs.
    They were orchestrated in such a way as to showcase the sweetness of the songs.</p><p>For <i>Osoro Nka</i>, children&rsquo;s
    voices were added as the song ended till it faded out. Now this &ldquo;twist&rdquo; was a bit tricky for me. Even
    though the lyrics said that God&rsquo;s children praise Him for what He does for them, the gimmick was really
    unnecessary. The song could have very well ended without it. However, I do doff my hats off for the arranger&rsquo;s
    ingenuity.</p><p>In general, the soprano part sounded non uniform. One voice could be heard over the top of the
    other soprano singers. For all the other three parts, you could hear the oneness of their respective voices although
    they were many.</p><p>As all but <i>The Grace</i> were in Twi, the choir did not have a hard time with articulation
    and so the lyrics are clearly heard. </p><p>There were other albums, including <i>Mpaebo Tiefo</i> by Caleb Joe
    Baffoe and the Royal Harmonials, <i>Hymns and their Meaning Vol 1 and 2 </i>by the Tarkwa Crusader Chorale and <i>Nya
        Gyedi</i> by the Gaddial Acquah Methodist Youth Choir that were released as well. I haven&rsquo;t had the chance
    to listen to them yet. Do get them as well for your listening pleasure.</p><p>Kudos to each of the Music Directors
    and Music Committees that spearheaded the production of these albums, and especially with the way the songs are
    interpreted to us the listeners. We expect nothing less from you in the coming years.</p><p><i>What was your
    favourite album last year? Let us know in the comments!</i>
