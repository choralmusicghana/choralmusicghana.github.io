<p>Twenty-fifth April brought the choral music year in KNUST to a close with the Ghana National Association of Adventist
    Students &#8211; KNUST holding the second edition of their KONCERTO program. It was also the occasion for the launch
    of their maiden album, “Basics”. With performances also from <a title="CCC Website"
                                                                    href="http://celestialcitych.webs.com/"
                                                                    target="_blank">Celestial City Choir</a>, Precious
    Memories, New Era and Vocal Harmony there was no wonder Koncerto pulled a moderately large crowd in spite of the
    fact that the university was in its examination week.</p>
<p>Much could have been said about the time for commencement, which was a good two and a half hours after the expected
    5pm. The programme consisted of two delightful packages consisting of local anthems from Sam Asare Bediako and Rev
    Newlove Annan as well as more popular songs from Handel and even Hans Zimmer.</p>
<p>The sound production left a lot to be desired, and it made what would have otherwise been an appreciable performance
    from the choir frustrating as I suffered to catch the lyrics to some of the words (Thank God for they were projected
    instead!). Choral Music Ghana did buy a copy of the Basics album and we are excited with what we have heard on it so
    far. Keep glued to this space for reasons why you should also cop this album soon.</p>
