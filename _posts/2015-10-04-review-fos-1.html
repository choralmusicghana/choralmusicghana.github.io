<p class="intro">Geneveeve&nbsp;Enam Akpalu did not miss Gramphone Ghana&rsquo;s most recent Fellowship of Songs held last week.
    This edition was extra special too: it was the first anniversary of the event; an important milestone in Ghana&rsquo;s
    choral music scene.</p><!-- more -->
<p>I cannot begin this review without first applauding <a
        href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fgramophonegh&amp;t=ODU4M2RiNjM0NmQwZDJlMTJlZjJmNWI3MzMzOTIyZDQ2Yjc4Y2Q2OCxvWWJidDd2Rw%3D%3D">Gramophone
    Chorus</a> for being time conscious. This is a trademark of theirs; at least, for the last two Fellowship of Songs
    (FOS) I have attended. </p>

<p>The FOS is a quarterly event organized by <a
        href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fgramophonegh&amp;t=ODU4M2RiNjM0NmQwZDJlMTJlZjJmNWI3MzMzOTIyZDQ2Yjc4Y2Q2OCxvWWJidDd2Rw%3D%3D">Gramophone
    Chorus</a>, to bring all Christians together to fellowship. It features hymns, classical pieces and hi-life medleys.
    The peculiar thing about this fifth edition, themed <i>Always On Our Side</i>, was that it was the first anniversary
    of the event. You could see and feel from the repertoire that their hearts were full of gratitude to God for the one
    year of the programme&rsquo;s successes amidst various challenges.&nbsp;</p><p>Their joy was palpable.</p>


<p>When I
    arrived at 5:50pm, the opening prayer was already being said. (They&rsquo;d asked that all be seated by 5:45pm for
    the commencement of the programme at 6:00pm.)</p><p>A sextet of alto and soprano gave the opening welcome; a
    beautiful rendition of <i>Lift Thine Eyes (Psalm 121)</i>. The piece created a calm atmosphere for the audience to
    receive the rest of the ministration. &nbsp;The MC, Dr. Clement Appah (who also sang a solo in the third package)
    gave a brief welcome and at exactly 6:00pm, the choir walked onto the stage beautifully clad and armed with their
    files.</p>

<p>The first
    package began with <i>O Thou Who Camest From Above (Psalm 99:1, Psalm 20:7)</i> followed by<i> How Great Thou
        Art</i> and then rounded up with <i>Battle Hymn of the Republic</i>, which quickened the tempo of the event.</p>
<p>Dr. George A. N. Donkor delivered a sermonette on the text <i>Luke 10:25-30</i>. In his message, he enjoined both the
    congregation and choristers to seek to move from their Jericho into the New Jerusalem, a place of blessing and
    eternal rest in God.</p>

</div>
<p>To go on, I must say that the congregation was well behaved, for the most part, clapping
    at the end of the songs and not during the singing. It was only until they were invited to join in singing <i>Kaashe
        Gbeyei (George Mensah Essilfie)</i> in the second package and thereafter.</p>

<p>This brings us
    to the second package. This included <i>Nyame Mma Monto Dwom (Sam Asare Bediako)</i>, <i>Praise Him! Praise Him!</i>,
    <i>Kaashe Gbeyei</i> and <i>The Blood Will Never Lose Its Power (Andrae Crouch)</i>.</p><p><br><i>The Blood Will
    Never Lose Its Power</i> and<i> Kaashe Gbeyei</i> were an added twist to the atmosphere. These songs sound more
    contemporary but they were beautifully sung chorally (if you get what I mean). The lead pianist overshadowed the
    choir a tad when the <i>Blood Will Never Lose Its Power</i> was being sung. Despite that, I felt the song&rsquo;s
    calming effect.</p><p>In commemoration of the anniversary, a cake was cut. The General Manager, Maukeni Padiki
    Kodjo, on behalf of the choir and <a
            href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fgramophonegh&amp;t=ODU4M2RiNjM0NmQwZDJlMTJlZjJmNWI3MzMzOTIyZDQ2Yjc4Y2Q2OCxvWWJidDd2Rw%3D%3D">Gramophone
        Ghana</a>, was especially grateful to God, parents and the congregation for supporting and being with them from
    the inception of FOS. <i>Thanks Be To Thee (G. F. Handel) </i>was accordingly chanted by the choir.</p>

<p>The audience was
    treated to two of their favourite songs the choir had ministered in previous FOSs - <i>Gyataburuwa,</i>&nbsp;<i>Thine
        Be The Glory</i> and <i>Sam Asare Bediako&rsquo;s &nbsp;Meyi M&rsquo;akyea</i> brought the third package to a
    close. </p><p>Stage craft was good, not excellent. The choristers did not rise or hold their files in uniformly. But
    that did not take away the beauty of the whole event. The voice of the choir was spot on and in harmony. Their
    diction was superb, as was their phrasing. And all these contributed immensely to my loving the ministration. The
    sound engineer did a great job although I could not hear the alto parts too well.</p><p>FOS is free but the cost
    involved is quite huge! There was a fundraising through sales of their CDs and pledges.</p><p>Being Ghanaian, and
    being a night of thanksgiving, FOS could not have ended without a hi-life medley. There was so much energy from both
    choristers and dancers.</p><p>It was an awesome experience and a memorable Sunday evening. <i>Kaashe Gbeyei</i> and
    <i>Gyataburuwa</i> continue to linger on my lips. I look forward to FOS VI in December 2015 which will most probably
    be at their usual venue &ndash; the <b><i>Trinity United Church on the Trinity Theological Seminary Campus,
        Legon</i></b>.</p><p>Gramophone, for the love of Jesus.</p><p>See ya!</p>
